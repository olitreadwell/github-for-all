# GitHub for All

This repository holds a companion README for the "GitHub for All" talk — a short lesson/presentation designed for non-developer startup founders and early-stage teams who want to learn the fundamentals of version control, Git, and GitHub so they can leverage GitHub features effectively.

## Who this is for

- Non-technical founders and startup operators
- Early-stage teams who want to manage documentation, product specs, and simple release workflows
- Students or community organisers preparing workshops on Git & GitHub

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session participants will be able to:

- Explain what Git and GitHub are and why they matter
- Initialize a repository, make commits, and understand the commit history
- Create branches and open pull requests (PRs) to collaborate safely
- Use GitHub features useful to startups (Gists, Issues, Projects, Actions, Releases)
- Discover learning resources and programs like GitHub for Startups and the Student Developer Pack
- Know where to find helpful tools: VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and curated lists of resources

## Suggested talk structure (30–45 minutes)

1. Quick intro & motivation (5 min)
	- Why version control matters even for non-devs (tracking changes, audit trail, collaboration)
2. Git basics demo (10–12 min)
	- init, add, commit, log
	- remote: add, push, clone
3. Branches & Pull Requests (10–12 min)

	- show a real PR on GitHub UI and explain checks and merge options
4. Useful GitHub features for startups (5–8 min)
	- Gists, Issues, Projects (or Discussions), Releases, GitHub Actions (brief)
5. Tools & learning resources (5 min)
