# Glossary — Common terms (accessible definitions)

This glossary provides short, plain-language definitions, simple analogies, and tips for ESL / ADHD / neurodivergent learners.

- Commit
  - Definition: A recorded snapshot of your project at a point in time.
  - Analogy: A "save" with a short sticky-note describing why you saved.
  - Tip: Keep commit messages short and focused. Use present-tense verbs.

- Repository (repo)
  - Definition: A folder for your project that stores files and the full history of changes.
  - Analogy: A filing cabinet with folders for each project.
  - Tip: One repo = one clear topic or project. Don't overload it.

- Branch
  - Definition: A separate line of work inside the same repo where you can try edits safely.
  - Analogy: A draft copy of a document where you can experiment.
  - Tip: Name branches clearly (e.g., `feature/update-readme`). Keep them short-lived.

- Pull Request (PR)
  - Definition: A request to merge changes from one branch into another, with space for review and comments.
  - Analogy: Passing your edited draft to a colleague asking "please review and merge".
  - Tip: Add a short description of why the change is useful.

- Merge
  - Definition: Bringing changes from one branch into another (often into `main`).
  - Analogy: Accepting a colleague's edits and adding them to the final document.

- Rebase
  - Definition: Rewriting commit history to apply your changes on top of a new base.
  - Analogy: Rewriting your edited draft so it looks like you started from the latest version.
  - Tip: Avoid rebasing public branches others use — it rewrites history.

- Remote / GitHub
  - Definition: The online copy of your repo where teammates can collaborate.
  - Analogy: A shared cloud filing cabinet everyone can access.
  - Tip: Push frequently and open PRs to share progress.

- Gist
  - Definition: A quick, shareable snippet or single-file note hosted by GitHub.
  - Analogy: A sticky note pinned to a project board.
  - Tip: Use for snippets you want to share publicly or privately.

- Clone
  - Definition: Make a local copy of a remote repo on your machine.
  - Analogy: Borrowing a folder from the filing cabinet to work on at your desk.
  - Tip: Clone only what you need; use shallow clones for very large repos when appropriate.
