# Lesson Plan — GitHub for All

Audience: college-age and above (non-developers, founders, students)
Duration: 45 minutes (with optional 20-minute hands-on)

Objectives

- Understand the purpose of version control and GitHub.
- Perform basic Git operations and collaborate using branches & pull requests.
- Identify GitHub features useful for startups and documentation workflows.

Structure (timeboxed)

1. Opening (3 min)

   - Hook: short story about losing important edits vs keeping history
   - Learning objectives and outcomes

2. Warm-up (5 min)

   - Quick analogies and a 1-minute demo of commit history
   - Check prior experience (thumbs up/down) and accessibility needs

3. Core demo (15 min)

   - Live: create a repo, make commits, create a branch, open a PR
   - Narrate: why each step matters; use short, intentional commits

4. Active learning (10–20 min)

   - Paired exercise from `MINI_EXERCISE.md` (create repo, push, PR)
   - Circulate to answer questions; use prompts to scaffold learners

5. Wrap-up & Next steps (5 min)
   - Share resources (`RESOURCES.md`) and encourage self-study
   - Quick reflection prompt: one thing learned, one remaining question

Teach Like A Champion-inspired techniques used

- Short, specific learning objectives (No vague outcomes)
- Cold call (randomly ask a participant to explain a short concept)
- Check for understanding frequently (thumbs, 1-sentence summaries)
- Do it again: brief repetition of core demo with different example
- Break tasks into micro-steps with visible success markers

Accessibility & inclusion

- Use clear, plain language and analogies (see `GLOSSARY.md`).
- Provide a text-only handout of commands and links.
- Accept multiple participation styles: pair work, silent hands-on, or observation.
- Offer extra time and one-on-one help for neurodivergent learners.

Materials for instructor

- Slide deck (optional) with screenshots for each demo step.
- Terminal commands cheat-sheet.
- A test repo prepared with starter README and sample issue.

Assessment

- Formative: observe PR creation and merging; ask 1–2 comprehension questions.
- Summative (optional): short quiz or a homework task to create a repo and open a PR.

Notes

- Keep demos short and avoid long live edits that can fail; use prepared screenshots if network is unreliable.
