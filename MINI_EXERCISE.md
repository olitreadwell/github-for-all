# Mini exercise — pre-presentation setup

This short checklist helps participants prepare before the workshop so the live portion runs smoothly. Estimated time: 10–25 minutes depending on install times.

1. Create or confirm your GitHub account

- Visit https://github.com and sign up or sign in.
- Tip: use an email you check and enable 2FA if possible (helps keep accounts secure).

2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) — optional for web-only users

- Download and install (if you want a local editor): https://code.visualstudio.com/
- If you don't want to install anything, you can use the GitHub web editor or Codespaces (see step 4).

3. Create a new repository on GitHub

- On GitHub click "New repository" → name it `github-for-all-demo` (public is fine) → optionally add a README → Create repository.

4. Edit files using the GitHub web UI or Codespaces (no terminal required)

- Web UI: On the repo page click `README.md` → pencil icon to edit → add a one-line "about me" → Commit changes directly to the `main` branch (use a meaningful message e.g. "Add attendee intro").
- Codespaces: click the green Code button → "Open with Codespaces" → "New codespace" (if available). Codespaces opens a browser-based VS Code with Git built-in.
- Web editor shortcut: press `.` on the repo page to open the in-browser editor if you prefer a multi-file web editor.

5. Create a new Issue on this repo (important for the workshop)

- Go to the `Issues` tab in this repository: https://github.com/olitreadwell/github-for-all/issues
- Click "New issue" and add:
  - Title: Brief descriptive title (e.g. "Help: Codespace not available")
  - Body: short description of the problem or question, your OS, browser, and steps you tried
  - Optional: attach a screenshot
- Submit the issue. This helps instructors triage problems and gives a real sample issue to discuss during the session.

6. Add the instructor as collaborator (optional for demo)

- If the instructor requested access: Settings → Manage access → Invite collaborator → add their GitHub handle.

7. Helpful self-study links on Skills

- Git basics and interactive exercises: https://skills.github.com/
- Search or browse Skills for short modules about Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows. These interactive labs are useful pre-work.

8. Quick checklist to bring to the workshop

- Confirm you can sign in to GitHub and create issues.
- Confirm the repository web editor or Codespace opens in your browser.
- Confirm you made at least one web UI commit to `README.md`.
- Keep a short note of any errors to ask about during the session.

If you need help ahead of time, share the issue in step 5 and an assistant will follow up during the workshop.
