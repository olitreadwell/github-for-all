# Mini exercise ‚Äî pre-presentation setup

This short checklist helps participants prepare before the workshop so the live portion runs smoothly. Estimated time: 10‚Äì25 minutes depending on install times.

1. Create or confirm your GitHub account

- Visit https://github.com and sign up or sign in.
- Tip: use an email you check and enable 2FA if possible (helps keep accounts secure).

2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ‚Äî optional for web-only users

- Download and install (if you want a local editor): https://code.visualstudio.com/
- If you don't want to install anything, you can use the GitHub web editor or Codespaces (see step 4).

3. Create a new repository on GitHub

- On GitHub click "New repository" ‚Üí name it `github-for-all-demo` (public is fine) ‚Üí optionally add a README ‚Üí Create repository.

4. Edit files using the GitHub web UI or Codespaces (no terminal required)

- Web UI: On the repo page click `README.md` ‚Üí pencil icon to edit ‚Üí add a one-line "about me" ‚Üí Commit changes directly to the `main` branch (use a meaningful message e.g. "Add attendee intro").
- Codespaces: click the green Code button ‚Üí "Open with Codespaces" ‚Üí "New codespace" (if available). Codespaces opens a browser-based VS Code with Git built-in.
- Web editor shortcut: press `.` on the repo page to open the in-browser editor if you prefer a multi-file web editor.

5. Create or upvote a Learning Goal issue (required for the workshop)

- Purpose: We use the `What I want to learn` template so learners can state goals and upvote others' requests. This helps the instructor prioritise topics.
- View existing learning goals: https://github.com/olitreadwell/github-for-all/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Alearning-goal
- If you see a learning goal you want covered, upvote it by adding a üëç reaction to the issue.
- If you don't find something that matches your need, create a new learning goal issue:
  1. Click "New issue" ‚Üí pick the **What I want to learn** template.
  2. Fill out the short form (one-line goal, why it matters, any constraints).
  3. Submit the issue. Example title: `Learning goal: Understand pull requests for docs`.

This step helps make the workshop responsive to the group's needs and gives instructors tangible priorities.

6. Add the instructor as collaborator (optional for demo)

- If the instructor requested access: Settings ‚Üí Manage access ‚Üí Invite collaborator ‚Üí add their GitHub handle.

7. Helpful self-study links on Skills

- Git basics and interactive exercises: https://skills.github.com/
- Search or browse Skills for short modules about Git, GitHub, and collaboration workflows. These interactive labs are useful pre-work.

8. Quick checklist to bring to the workshop

- Confirm you can sign in to GitHub and create issues.
- Confirm the repository web editor or Codespace opens in your browser.
- Confirm you made at least one web UI commit to `README.md`.
- Keep a short note of any errors to ask about during the session.

If you need help ahead of time, share the issue in step 5 and an assistant will follow up during the workshop.
